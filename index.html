				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a trans software engineer living in Charlotte, NC. My pronouns are <strong>she/her</strong>.
					I graduated Cum Laude from Clemson University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, and a minor in German Studies, with General Honors from the Honors College.
					You may know me from work, or from some of the creative side projects I do from time to time. 
					Maybe, you're <em>just</em> cool enough to know me personally.
					I've done a lot of cool things I'm proud of before now, but some of them were under a different name. 
					Let's both be cool about it, okay? Thanks.
