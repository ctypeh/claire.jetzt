# About
Little blurbs or short passages of text that I'd like to save for future use on my website, in case they're necessary.

## About
This is a static web page, which I like to redesign every couple of months. It's a nice way for me to relax and enjoy the simplicity in coding, as well as pick up some new skills along the way. It's hosted on Github Pages, where you can view the code, and suggest any improvements you like. If you have something to share, I'd really appreciate your perspective.
