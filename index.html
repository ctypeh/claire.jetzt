		<h2><span id="greeting">Hello,</span></h2><br>
		<h1>I'm <span class="highlight">Claire Violet</span><span class="rainbow">.</span></h1>

		<p>
			I'm a trans software engineer. My pronouns are she/her or it/its, whichever you feel comfortable using.
			I am moving to Seattle, Washington after living and working in Charlotte, North Carolina for 3 years. <!--I currently work at <a alt="" href="">company</a>. Previously, I worked at Ally for 3 years after graudating from the Clemson University School of Computing. -->You might know me from work, my very silly hobbies, or from some of the other creative side projects I do from time to time. Most notably, I run the <a alt="A Minecraft Server for Do By Friday Fans, and More" href="https://legos.digital/">legos.digital</a> minecraft server!
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm currently looking for my next challenge! If you have an opportunity you'd like to tell me about, or if you'd like to see my resume, please <a alt="Send Claire an Email about Job Offers"  href="mailto:work@claire.jetzt?subject=Come%20work%20with%20me!&body=Hallo Claire, ">send me an email</a>! I'm really interested in hearing what you and your team are passionate about building, if you think I could be a part of that. As always, feel free to reach out just to chat at the email below.

		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>
			This is a static web page, which I like to redesign every couple of months. It's a nice way for me to relax and enjoy the simplicity in coding, as well as pick up some new skills along the way. It's hosted on <a alt="The Source Code for this Website" href="https://github.com/ctypeh/claire.jetzt">Github Pages</a>, where you can view the code, and suggest any improvements you like.
		</p>
		-->
		<h3 id="Colorway">About the Colors</h3>
		<p>
			This website makes liberal use of my favorite Pantone colors, <span onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('#fedb00')" class="yellow">&#9679;</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantone.com/connect/108-C">108&nbsp;C</a> and <span onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('#440099')"  class="violet">&#9679;</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantone.com/connect/VIOLET-C">Violet&nbsp;C</a>.<sup><em>&dagger;&#x2021;</em></sup> I love to use vibrant color wherever I can, and these two colors have represented me across the internet for quite a while now. I love how warm and full of sunlight this particular yellow is, and yes, it makes a great accent wall.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Colophon">Note on the Type</h3>
		<p>
			This website is typeset in <a alt="Information on the Typeface" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>, an experimental and open-source typeface created in 2016 by Rasmus Andersson. Inter was designed specifically for computer-screens, with the intent of crafting highly-readable user interfaces. It's a beautifully clear but subtle typeface that departs from the all-encompassing use of Helvetica.
