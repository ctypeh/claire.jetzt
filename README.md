# Before You Read The Code
I write this website with the most simplistic HTML and CSS that I can, pulling and pushing changes for content updates, typos, hex code color corrections, fixing margins, and all that lovely stuff. Web development is something that I do for work within frameworks and the safe and familiar confines of Bootstrap. Maintaining my website is, most importantly, a way for me to *relax* in coding, as I solve little layout puzzles and try to learn new features. I'd love to learn new ways to do things with minimal web tools, so if you have a suggestion, please let me know! Do you know how I could make something more accessible? Did you find something that was broken? Are you frustrated by how badly something is implemented? Send me an email, I'd love to know how to fix it, and do better.
