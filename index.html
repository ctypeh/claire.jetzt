			<p>
				I'm a trans photographer and software engineer. My pronouns are she/her or it/its, whichever you feel most comfortable using. I live in beautiful, sunny Seattle, Washington. Since 2022, I've been volunteering as the archivist for the <a title="The Connections Museum of Electromechanical Telephone Switching" href="https://connections.museum">Connections Museum</a>, preserving and organizing their library's unique collection of telecommunications history. I love good design, philately, trains, and protected bike lanes.

			<h3>Photography</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://glass.photo/108c">You can see the best of my photography on Glass.</a> Glass is a community and photo-sharing app for photographers, that I've really enjoyed using. You don't need an account to browse my work, and you can even follow my posts there without making an account <a href="http://glass.photo/108c/rss">via the RSS feed.</a> If I ever have news about projects I'm working on, a run of prints available, or maybe one day a small photobook project, I'll announce more information about that here on my website and on Glass. If you like one of my photos very much, please get in touch, and I would be happy to sell you a one-off custom print. Thanks for taking an interest!
			</p>
			<h3>Archives</h3>
			<p>
				Historic preservation, especially of graphic design and ephemeral media, through digitization is really important to me. I've digitized a lot of documents for the Connections Museum Seattle—many of which are available on <a href="https://archive.org/details/@108c" style="overflow-wrap: anywhere !important;">my Internet Archive profile</a>—including a <a href="https://archive.org/details/@108c/lists/1/bell-system---graphics-standards-manuals" style="line-break: anywhere;">large collection of the Bell System's graphical standards manuals done by Saul Bass in 1969,</a> which I think are just stunningly gorgeous.

			<h3 id="colorway">About the Colors</h3>
			<p>
				This website makes liberal use of my favorite PANTONE colors, <span onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('#fedb00')" class="yellow">●</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantone.com/connect/108-C">108&nbsp;C</a> and <span onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('#440099')"  class="violet">●</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantone.com/connect/VIOLET-C">Violet&nbsp;C</a>.<sup><em>†‡</em></sup> I love to use vibrant color wherever I can, and these two colors have represented me across the internet for quite a while now. I love how warm and full of sunlight this particular yellow is. Violet is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color">spectral color</a> and likely isn't depicted very well on your device's screen.

			<h3 id="colophon">Note on the Type</h3>
			<p>
				This website is typeset in <a title="Information on the Typeface" href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter,</a> an experimental and open-source typeface created in 2016 by Rasmus Andersson. Inter was designed specifically for computer-screens, with the intent of crafting highly-readable user interfaces. It's a beautifully clear but subtle typeface that departs from the all-encompassing use of Helvetica. <a title="Notable projects using the typeface Inter" href="https://github.com/rsms/inter#notable-projects-using-inter">Perhaps you recognize it?</a>
